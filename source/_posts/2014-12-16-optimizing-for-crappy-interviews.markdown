Have you noticed that there are so many different styles of
interviews?

Recently on /r/programming, there have been a rash of people
complaining that interviews are terrible. My favorite was the
commenter who claimed to make the typical FizzBuzz test a tiny bit
harder by asking for a new word on prime numbers, and no using a
library call! When others pointed out how hard that is, he was like
"aren't primes just not evenly divisible by 2 or 3?"

I saw that comment, and I knew I had a perfect example for the state
of interviewing!
