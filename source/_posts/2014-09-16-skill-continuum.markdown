        Learning Vim is a waste of time; I can and will prove it! -

I recently had a gentle discussion with a new teammate about whether
or not they should learn to use Vim. My team uses a Vim emulator
inside Visual Studio, and so we recommended he learn at least the
basics so to reduce friction when pair-programming (which we do almost
all the time).

He really had no desire to learn it, and took a small amount of
offense when we suggested it. The friction he felt trying to "start
over" really bothered him. He set out to prove that Vim was not worth
his time, and that it was actually us who needed to stop using it,
because we were slower by using it.

As any such localized experiments go, he never really came up with
anything conclusive either way. Personally, I suspect he spent more
mental energy trying to figure out why Vim was worse than if he had
just learned it. We mostly shrugged it off, and that was that. It got
me thinking about skills we learn as developers, and how much they
cost.

Most skills fall along a continuum of tactical to strategic.
