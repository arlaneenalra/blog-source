        Learning Vim is a waste of time; I can prove it! - Anonymous
        
I recently had a gentle discussion with a new teammate about whether
or not they should learn to use Vim. My team uses a Vim emulator
inside Visual Studio, and so we recommended he learn at least the
basics so to reduce friction when pair-programming (which we do almost
all the time).

He really had no desire to learn it, and took a small amount of
offense when we suggested it. The friction he felt trying to "start
over" really bothered him. He set out to prove that Vim was not worth
his time, and that it was actually us who needed to stop using it,
because we were slower by using it.

As any such localized experiments go, he never really came up with
anything conclusive either way. Personally, I suspect he spent more
time and mental energy trying to figure out why Vim was worse than if
he had just buckled down and learned it. This got me thinking about
skills we learn as developers, and how much they cost.

Most skills fall along a continuum of tactical to strategic.

Tactical Skills
* Typing speed/accuracy
* Editor shortcuts
* "Mouse-free" editing systems: Vim, Emacs
* Clean coding practices
* Refactoring tools
* Repl Driven Development

Midway Skills
* Debugging
* Unit testing
* Building abstractions

Strategic Skills
* Gathering requirements
* Training developers
* Organizing teams
* Understanding the real problem
* Learning new languages and frameworks
* Automating tasks
* Designing simple solutions

The more strategic the skills, the "softer" they become. The reason
for this is that soft skills often allow for the greatest leverage on
a project.

Why is this?

Consider the developer, who by more accurately gathering requirements
for a few days, realizes that the stakeholder can use a preexisting
solution instead of a six month planned project. If you consider how
many keystrokes he saved, there is no way he could have possibly typed
fast enough or refactored efficiently enough to make up for that saved
six months of effort. Unless he could've typed out a six month project
in those few days, his time was better spent where it was. Obviously,
these opportunities do not happen all the time, but they _do_ happen.

Think about the return on investment for training developers. If you
have an evenly distributed team, there is a good chance you have some
lower performing developers. I have witnessed times where a few weeks of
pairing to brush up the skills of a less skilled developer caused them
to suddenly become much more productive. In terms of total company
effort, that small investment paid back many times before the end of
the year as the newly trained developer was able to tackle their work
with a renewed vigor that comes from a greater mastery of their domain.

Similarly, I have seen the judicious use of automation for deployment,
testing, and building greatly reduce the friction of development for
entire teams.

That being said, I think there comes a point where you have to put
fingers to keyboard and actually produce working software. Of course,
the fastest and best software is the software you never have to
write. But, when you absolutely must write new software, the skill to
actually execute becomes very important. Tactical skills increase in
significance the closer you get to work.

While a fast software tactician will never "beat" a great strategist
in terms of raw business value, a great strategist that is a terrible
tactician will be significantly hampered. A strategist who forgets or
ignores good tactics or works counter to the main purpose of adding
business value is what we call an "architecture astronaut" or an
"ivory tower architect".

I think a developer who wants to improve should make sure they are
improving all across the spectrum. Don't fall into the trap of
focusing more on strategic skills, letting the tactical skill
atrophy. 

Lastly, on the subject of "what to study". I think it is possible to
study a number of subjects all across the continuum all at
once. Unless you have weeks where you never type any code at all, you
can practice and learn new tactical techniques all the time. If it
slows you down today, but speeds you up next week, chances are it is
worth it. Even if it slowed you down to a quarter your usual speed for
two weeks, but then gives you a measly 5% boost to productively
after that, you'll earn that time back by the end of the year, plus
some. And 5% is not hard to do. I'd guess learning a few new
navigation or refactoring shortcuts would net you 5% easily.

When studying more strategic skills, the same holds, but they are
harder to learn. The best way I have found for learning strategic
skills is to read books about it, and try to work around others who
are good at it. Neither books or working with others will get you all
the way there, you also have to apply it yourself.
