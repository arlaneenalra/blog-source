I think I have figured out why everyone hates everyone else's code.

### Humans do not have the mental capacity to write good software. 

"But wait, Steve, I am awesome at what I do! I know all the patterns,
follow all the trends, and read all the blogs. Don't lump me in with
the slackers, the architecture astronauts, the language enthusiasts!"

I promise you I can find a pile of developers who will hate your code. 

As an industry, we all muddle along, and most of the time, we can
produce more value than we consume. I personally know I have been
profitable to my employers for a while now. This is a good thing, to
be profitable. 

We don't have be good at software to be profitable.

Don't take it the wrong way, we get a lot done. We solve so many
problems, and manage to produce so much good. No offense intended,
but, let's be honest, how many of us are confident in everything we
have written? Did it scale, was it easy to hand-off, was it tested,
was it secure, did it come out in time? Chances are, no, it didn't.

So, programming is too hard for humans. Now what? I think we need to
start simplifying the craft. I think we need to start consolidating
languages, databases, tools. Instead of adding another mustache
library or blog platform, we need to start focusing our efforts. 

I think the language designers need to start making languages simpler
and safer to use. I started learning Haskell and F# this year, and was
amazed at how much easier it was to get right.
