I think I have figured out why everyone hates everyone else's code.

### Humans do not have the mental capacity to write good software. 

"But wait, Steve, I am awesome at what I do! I know all the patterns,
follow all the trends, and read all the blogs. Don't lump me in with
the slackers, the architecture astronauts, the language enthusiasts!"

I promise you I can find other equally good developers who will hate
your code.

As an industry, we all muddle along, and most of the time, we can
produce more value than we consume. I personally know I have been
profitable to my employers for a while now. This is a good thing, to
be profitable. 

We don't have be good at software to be profitable.

Don't take it the wrong way, we get a lot done. We solve so many
problems, and manage to produce so much good. No offense intended,
but, let's be honest, how many of us are confident in everything we
have written? Did it scale, was it easy to hand-off, was it tested,
was it secure, did it come out in time? Chances are, no, it didn't.

So, programming is too hard for humans. Now what? I think we need to
start simplifying the craft. Accepting our limitations is the first
step to working around them. The developer who doesn't trust their own
abilites to build "good software" will take even greater care. The
humble developer keeps up with good practices, keeps refining their
understanding of what makes code "good" and keeps
